<h1>First steps</h1>
<p>One diagram is defined by a <a href="http://www.json.org/" target="_blank">JSON</a> array. The array contains the title of the diagram
  and a list of components, which will be presented in it as boxes.</p> 
  <p>Here is an empty diagram:</p>

  <h3>Input:</h3>
  <pre>["A Graphic"]</pre>
 <h3>Output:</h3>
 <div class="info">["A Graphic"]</div>
  
  
 <p> A box is defined again by an array which <em>must</em> contain at least one element, the name of the box, but <em>can</em> contain a lot more.</p>
    <h3>Input:</h3>
  <pre>["A Graphic", ["A Box"]]</pre>
 <h3>Output:</h3>
 <div class="info">["A Graphic", ["A Box"]]</div>
  

  
<h1>Setting Box Position</h1>
  <p>The position of each box is a two-character string, which uses the convention used in the chess board (except that I don't play 
  chess so the numbers are from top to bottom). For example "A1" positions the block at
  the top left corner, "A2" is on the right of "A1" etc.<p>
  
  <p>The size of the board is calculated automatically and it can go up to 9.</p>
  
  <h3>Input:</h3>
  <pre>["Box Position", 
 ["A1", "A1"],
 ["A2", "A2"],
 ["A3", "A3"],

 ["B1", "B1"],
 ["B2", "B2"],
 ["B3", "B3"],
 ["C1", "C1"],
 ["C2", "C2"],
 ["C3", "C3"]
]</pre>
 <h3>Output:</h3>
 <div class="info">["Box Position",
 ["A1", "A1"],
 ["A2", "A2"],
 ["A3", "A3"],

 ["B1", "B1"],
 ["B2", "B2"],
 ["B3", "B3"],
 ["C1", "C1"],
 ["C2", "C2"],
 ["C3", "C3"]
]</div>

<h1>Children</h1>
  <p>Components are composed of smaller components. 
  In Graphs this is reflected by the ability for each box to have children which are shown only when the user clicks on it.<p>
  <h3>Input:</h3>
  <pre>["Children", 
 ["A Parent", "a2", 
   ["Child 1", "a2"],
   ["Child 2", "b2"],
   ["Child 3", "c2"]
 ]

]
</pre>
 <h3>Output:</h3>
 <div class="info">["Children", 
 ["A Parent", "a2", 
   ["Child 1", "a2"],
   ["Child 2", "b2"],
   ["Child 3", "c2"]
 ]

]
</div>
  <p>You can have more than two levels. Each level has different CSS attributes<p>
  <h3>Input:</h3>
  <pre>["Children", 
  ["First", 
    ["Second",
      ["Third"]
    ]
  ]
] 

<h1>Applying Styling</h1>
  <p>Stress on a certain box by applying different CSS styling.</p>
  <p>To add styling, include a property with one of the CSS styles which are defined as graphs constants: 'important', 'minor'</p>
  
  <h3>Input:</h3>
  <pre>["Box Position", 
 ["A1", "A1"],
 ["A2", "A2"],
 ["A3", "A3"],

 ["B1", "B1"],
 ["B2", "B2"],
 ["B3", "B3"],
 ["C1", "C1"],
 ["C2", "C2"],
 ["C3", "C3"]
]</pre>
 <h3>Output:</h3>
 <div class="info">["Styling",
 ["Ordinary Box1", "A1"],
 ["Ordinary Box2", "A2"],
 ["A very important box", "A3"],

 ["Ordinary Box3", "B1"],
 ["Ordinary Box4", "B2"],
 ["Not Very Important Box", "B3"],

]</div>




</pre>
 <h3>Output:</h3>
 <div class="info">["Children", 
  ["First", 
    ["Second",
      ["Third"]
    ]
  ]
]
</div>



 <h1>Your Turn</h1>
<p>Start typing to visualize the graphic.<p>

  <h3>Input:</h3>

<textarea id="json" class="json" >
["root", 
 ["block", "a1"],
 ["block2", "a2"]
]
</textarea>

  <h3>Output:</h3>
<div class="jsoninput"></div>
